RSYNC-GUI
=========

A small macOS SwiftUI GUI wrapper for rsync. It lets you pick local source/target paths (via a file browser), enter remote rsync-style endpoints (user@host:/path), toggle the most popular rsync options, preview the generated command, and run rsync while capturing stdout/stderr into an output pane.

This repository contains a minimal, modern-looking macOS app that demonstrates the core features you requested. It intentionally relies on the system rsync and ssh for remote transfers.

Quick features
- Local and remote source/target selection (remote entered as `user@host:/path`).
- Common options exposed: Archive (-a), Verbose (-v), Human readable (-h), --progress, --delete, --dry-run.
- Toggle to copy folder contents vs folder itself (adds trailing slash to the source path).
- Command preview (monospaced) and Run/Stop controls.
- Output console capturing stdout and stderr.

How it works
- The app generates an `rsync` command and runs it using `/bin/bash -lc "<command>"` to allow SSH agent forwarding and shell features.
- Remote browsing is not fully implemented; remote endpoints are entered manually. Implementing a full remote file browser requires either:
  - Running `ssh user@host ls -la ...` and parsing the output (basic approach), or
  - Integrating an SSH/SFTP library (libssh2, NMSSH, or similar) for a more robust UI experience.

Requirements
- macOS (development done with SwiftUI). Project is not sandboxed in this demo.
- `rsync` available on PATH (macOS ships with rsync; you can also install a newer rsync with Homebrew if desired).
- SSH access to remote hosts for remote-to-remote transfers. The app does not manage SSH keys or passwords â€” it relies on the system SSH agent or interactive prompts.

Build & run
1. Open `RSYNC-GUI.xcodeproj` in Xcode (or the workspace if present).
2. Select the macOS target and run the app.

Notes and caveats
- Authentication: For unattended transfers, configure SSH keys and an ssh-agent. The GUI will not capture interactive password prompts reliably. Use passwordless authentication keys for app as it can't reliably use passphrases yet.
- Trailing slash: The "Copy contents of folder" toggle appends a trailing slash to the source path when enabled. This is how rsync distinguishes copying the folder contents (trailing slash) vs the folder itself.
- Output streaming: The app captures stdout and stderr and shows them in the Output pane. If you need truly real-time streaming for very verbose transfers, we can refine the reading loop to use incremental reads of availableData instead of readToEnd() in some setups.

Next improvements (optional)
- Add remote browsing modal that shells out to `ssh user@host ls -la` and lets users pick remote directories.
- Integrate SFTP/SSH library for a native remote browser (better UX and progress reporting).
- Add profiles/presets saving common targets and option sets.
- Add code signing & entitlements if distributing outside development.

Thanks for using RSYNC-GUI!
